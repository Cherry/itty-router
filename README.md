# itty-router
It's an itty bitty router. That means small.  It's tiny.  For reals.

## Our Goals
- [ ] have a simple express-like (or better) interface
- [ ] have a chainable interface!
- [ ] be tiny
- [ ] be easy to use/implement
- [ ] have as few dependencies as possible (or none)
- [ ] have test coverage
- [x] have a README
- [ ] have a way to release
- [ ] have pretty code
- [ ] handle all the basics of routing within a serverless function
- [ ] be platform agnostic (or handle the responses of the major platforms)
